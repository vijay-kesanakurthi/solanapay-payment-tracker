# SolanaPay Payment Tracker

This project is a web application that allows users to track and receive notifications for payments made to their Solana wallet using QR codes and webhooks. The project is created using Next.js, a React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.

## Features

- Generate a QR code for your Solana wallet address that can be scanned by other users to send you payments.
- Listen to the Solana network for incoming transactions to your wallet address using Helius, a webhook service for Solana events.
- Play a sound and display a message when a payment is received.
- View the history of payments received and the details of each transaction.

## How it works

- The project uses [SolanaPay], a payment gateway for Solana that provides APIs and SDKs for integrating Solana payments into web applications.
- The project uses [Helius], a webhook service for Solana that allows users to subscribe to events on the Solana network and receive notifications via HTTP callbacks.
- The project uses [Next.js], a React framework for building fast and scalable web applications with features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
- The project uses [Tailwind CSS], a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
